# Slack

Slack is a communication tool we will be using in Intro to Programming. By the first day of class, you will be added to a channel, or chatroom, for your cohort. The cohort will be named after the start date. For example, if your cohort starts on Aug 20, 2019, the channel name will be 190820 (YYMMDD).

## Class Notes
In the cohort channel is where I will sending out class notes and hint files. This chatroom will keep chat history for about 6 months.
