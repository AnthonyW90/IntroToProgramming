# 1: Configuring our Environment

## Installing Python

[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is a version of python that comes bundled with other useful packages. It's very easy to install.

You can also download and install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) directly.

## Installing and Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Windows

Windows comes with `Command Prompt` by default. To open it, search for it in your applications, press windows+r, then type 'cmd' and hit 'ok'. You can pin it to your taskbar or create a shortcut to access it later. Common commands are `dir` to list the contents of a directory, `cd <name>` to change directories. You can even ping websites `ping www.google.com`.

One alternative to `cmd` is [cmder](http://cmder.net/), which also comes with git and allows for unix-like commands like `ls`.

Another alternative is Power Shell


### Mac


### Linux


CTRL + ALT + T

### Using Python in the CLI

Once you've established your CLI, the first thing to do is try typing `python --version`. It should say it's running python `3.6.1`, otherwise try `python3 --version`.

To open the `interactive interpreter`, type `python` and hit enter. It should then show `>>>` on the left side. You can know execute statements like 5 + 2 and True or False in the terminal, and python with interpret them for you.

To execute source code in a text file, type `python <filename>`, remember that python source code should be store in a text file with extension `.py`.



## Installing a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Much of our coding will consist of editing source code contained in text files, given the extension `.py`. You can use any text editor, but some have additional features tailored toward editing source code, like syntax hightlighting.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a light-weight text editor.

On the welcome screen, you can select 'install a package', or go to file->settings and select `+ install` on the left. Type 'script' and select the `script` package. You can then run python files with `ctrl + shift + b`.

[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) is a full-fledged IDE, with debugging tools, linting, refactoring, and inspections.

Other options you might check out are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows Only).
