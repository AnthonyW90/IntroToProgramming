1. Create a new file `hello.py`
2. Say hello! with the following code:

```python
print("Hello!")
```
Switch to your terminal and run the following command:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```

## Advance 1 - Concatenating
Edit your code to concatenate two strings:

```python
print("Hello" + "World")
```
Switch to your terminal and run the following command:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```

## Advance 2 - Variables & fstrings
Edit your code to print variables instead:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
planet = "World"
print(greeting + planet)
```
Switch to your terminal and run the following command:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```

Alternatively, you can print variables INSIDE strings but you have to **format** it correctly:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
planet = "World"
print(f"Today in class, we learned how to print {greeting} {planet}!")
```
Notice the **f** before the quotation marks?

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```
