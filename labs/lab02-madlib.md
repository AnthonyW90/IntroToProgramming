---Write a simple program that prompts the user for several inputs then
 prints a [Mad Lib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) as the result.

 ## Instructions
 1. Search the interwebs for a quote that you like
 2. Create a new file and save it as `madlib.py`
 3. Ask the user for words to replace key words in the quote
 4. Use an `fstring` to put each word into the Mad Lib

```
>>> Give me a name: Ronald
>>> Give me a place: The North Pole
Ronald, I've a feeling we're not in The North Pole anymore.
Original quote: Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
```

## Advanced 1

* Let the user choose between two movies
* Using if conditionals, let the user play a Mad Lib based on a quote from the chosen movie

## Super Advanced 1

* For each type of word that the user enters (noun, verb, adverb, etc.) append it to a list
* Shuffle the list
* Apply the shuffled words to the Mad Lib
